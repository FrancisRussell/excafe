 - Dolfin (https://launchpad.net/dolfin)
 - FFC (https://launchpad.net/ffc)

 All the above are installable on a Debian/Ubuntu system from standard
 packages.

To build:
 
If configure is not present, run ./bootstrap
- Run:
 
  ./configure

  then 

  make

The folder 'navier_stokes' contains a coupled incompressible Navier-Stokes
solver that simulates 2D fluid flow around a cyliner.

The folder 'mass_matrix_generator_2d' contains the executable that uses Excafé
to generate mass matrix and Laplacian operator examples for the ACM Transactions
on Mathematical Software paper.
